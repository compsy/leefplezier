    "abstract": "Each person is different and should be treated as such. Comparing personal data to group averages can give basic ideas about personal conditions, but does not suffice for providing `true' personalized feedback. In health psychology, a paradigm shift is taking place from a general population approach towards a more person-centered one. Instead of comparing a person with population averages, the focus shifts towards comparing a person with themselves over time. ",
