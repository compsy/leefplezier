The Leefplezier project
=======================

Comparting a person to averaged group data is insufficient nowadays. The Leefplezier project focuses on measuring a large group of elderly people and providing them with interesting, personalized feedback. We are currently designing a number of ict facilities, In order to perform these measurements and perform the analysis to provide insightful feedback on a large scale.

First a web application is created. The web application is used to conduct a series of questionnaires, in order to gain knowledge about and insight in the participants their wellbeing. The web application consists of two main components: A system which allows for the conductance of questionnaires and a system for analyzing the data and creating feedback. The scientific important part of the project is finding or creating a way to effectively analyze and to provide feedback on the data (gained by conducting the questionnaires).

Secondly a mobile phone app is developed for taking basic measurements (for example movement or heart rate), and could also be used as Ecological Momentary Assesment (EMA) / diary device. The experience sampling method is a way to capture experiences on a regular basis.

In 2013 a project called [HoeGekIsNL?](https://www.hoegekis.nl) started as a preliminary project for the Leefplezier project. With HoeGekIsNL? we would like to see the positive and negative emotions, and the amount of these feelings for the Dutch people.
