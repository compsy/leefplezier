<p>The Leefplezier project focuses on measuring a large group of elderly people and providing them with interesting, personalized feedback. In order to perform these measurements on such a large scale, we are currently designing a number of ict facilities.</p>

<p>First a web application is created. The web application is used to conduct a series of questionnaires, in order to gain knowledge about and insight in the people their well-being. The web application consists of two main components: A system which allows for the conductance of questionnaires and a system for analyzing the data and creating feedback. The scientific important part of the project is finding or creating a way to effectively analyze and to provide feedback on the data (gained by conducting the questionnaires).</p>

<p>Secondly a mobile phone app is developed for taking basic measurements (for example movement or heart rate), and could also be used as Experience Sampling Method (ESM) / diary device. The experience sampling method is a way to capture experiences on a regular basis. Important is that this phone app is built as proof of concept, and is built for research purposes only. That is, the application which will be built will only be created (and maybe maintained) for a single device system (e.g., Android, iOS or Windows) and is not built with the purpose of selling in a later stadium of the project.</p>

<p>In 2013 a project called <a href="https://www.hoegekis.nl">HoeGekIsNL?</a> started as a preliminary project for the Gelukskompas project. With HoeGekIsNL? we would like to see the positive and negative emotions, and the amount of these feelings for the Dutch people.</p>
